Mattermost and Slack are both popular team collaboration platforms that offer the ability to use **slash commands**—special commands that are prefixed with a `/`—to trigger specific actions or integrations within the platform. Here's an overview of what slash commands are and how they work in both Mattermost and Slack:

### **Mattermost Slash Commands**

In **Mattermost**, slash commands are used to quickly execute actions or access certain features without leaving the chat interface. These commands can be either built-in or custom, allowing users to interact with the platform in an efficient way.

#### Examples of Built-in Mattermost Slash Commands:
1. **`/help`** - Displays a list of available slash commands and help text.
2. **`/away`** - Sets your status to "away."
3. **`/status <status message>`** - Updates your status message.
4. **`/join <channel>`** - Joins a specific channel.
5. **`/leave`** - Leaves the current channel.

In addition to these built-in commands, Mattermost also allows the integration of custom slash commands. For example, you can set up commands to interact with external tools (like GitHub, JIRA, or other custom services), perform automated tasks, or run scripts directly within Mattermost.

### **Slack Slash Commands**

In **Slack**, slash commands are used for similar purposes to quickly perform tasks without needing to navigate through the app's UI. Many of these commands are built into Slack, but you can also create custom commands to trigger integrations with third-party tools or automate workflows.

#### Examples of Built-in Slack Slash Commands:
1. **`/help`** - Provides a list of available slash commands.
2. **`/away`** - Sets your status to "away."
3. **`/mute`** - Mutes notifications for the current channel.
4. **`/dnd`** (Do Not Disturb) - Toggles your Do Not Disturb status.
5. **`/remind`** - Creates reminders, e.g., `/remind me to check emails at 3 PM`.
6. **`/leave`** - Leaves the current channel.
7. **`/invite <user>`** - Invites a user to a channel.

Additionally, **Slack allows the creation of custom slash commands** via its API. For instance, a custom command might allow users to:
- Query a database
- Run a bot
- Trigger automated workflows (using tools like Zapier, Integromat, or Slack's Workflow Builder)

When you create a custom slash command in Slack, you specify a URL to which the command sends a request, allowing your server or application to return a response, which Slack then displays in the chat.

### Key Differences Between Mattermost and Slack Slash Commands:
- **Customization**: Both platforms support custom slash commands, but Mattermost tends to be more developer-centric with its flexibility, allowing more granular control over the integration and setup of custom commands.
- **Integrations**: Slack has a much larger ecosystem of integrations and built-in tools, so many common tools (like Google Calendar, GitHub, Trello, etc.) offer ready-made slash commands. Mattermost supports integrations too, but they may require more custom configuration or self-hosted setups.
  
### Use Cases for Slash Commands:
1. **Task management**: `/remind` (Slack) or custom task management integrations.
2. **Notification control**: `/away`, `/dnd`, `/mute`.
3. **Team collaboration**: `/join` and `/leave` commands help manage channels.
4. **Custom integrations**: Commands that fetch data from other platforms (e.g., GitHub issues, JIRA tickets) and display them in your chat.

In both platforms, slash commands help improve productivity by reducing the need to switch between apps or navigate complex menus—users can simply type a command to get things done quickly.
